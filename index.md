Seed coating, pelleting and enhancement, is a rapidly evolving technology that is becoming a common addition to many seeds that are sold around the world today. Once considered as "smoke & mirrors" and an art, the science of Seed Coating is becoming recognised as a very useful tool to enable better seed handling, improved seedling emergence & survival, and for better overall crop performance.

During the last 30 years, the equipment and formulas have advanced at a rapid pace and todays progressive seed companys' use the technology to add some of the many available enhancements to the seeds.
