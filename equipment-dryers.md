Various types of dryers are available to dry treated or coated seeds and this is most often the area that can create the biggest bottleneck and inefficiencies in the plant, so choosing the correct type of dryer to handle and dry your seeds is important.  Whether you require a small laboratory sized dryer, or a large commercial dryer, I can offer advice to help you with the best method and size for your needs.

  â€‹When set up correctly, fluidised beds offer an efficient and clean method for drying some seed types.  They can be supplied in various sizes and steel types and I work closely with the manufacturer to ensure the correct features and quality are provided.

Some light and fluffy seeds require other methods of drying, as they do not readily fluidise, so alternative dryer designs are required.
