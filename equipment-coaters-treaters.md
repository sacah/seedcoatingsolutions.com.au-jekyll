As the seed coating and enhancements industry evolves, so does the equipment that helps you to achieve your goals.  In the area of coaters, I have worked with several methods of achieving coats, pellets and granulations, such as pansâ€‹, paddles, tumblers and rotostats.

The Rotostat technology is now widely used in the seed industry both as treaters and as coaters.    When used correctly, Rotostats offer a safe and efficient method to provide you with quality treated or coated products.  They can be supplied in various sizes and configurations, depending upon your requirements. 

I first used the BraceWorks Rotostat coaters in 2001 and since that time I have installed dozens of these machines in many locations around the world.  I found them to be very reliable and relatively easy to operate, so it was an easy decision for me to become a distributor for them when I started my new business.  Although we have standard machines, we are also able and happy to custom design a machine that would best suit our customers' needs.

There are many features that make the BraceWorks coaters ideal for coating, especially the program control, but one of the things that I like most about them, is that they have continued to evolve and improve as the industry has further advanced the coatings and enhancements.
